# OctoPrint-Dashboard

A dashboard tab for Octoprint that displays the most relevant info regarding the state of the printer and any on-going print jobs.

This is a work in progress and may be buggy and/or incomplete

TODOs:
Styling
Current Fan Speed
Current layer of total layers
Current height of total height
Progress Graph
Support for multiple hotends
Localization support

Nice to haves:
Chamber temp
SoC temp
Room temp?
Minimalistic temp graphs for hotend and bed.
Time spent per layer graph?
